# Watch It Stop

I want to get a better sense of what it actually looks like when services die, so I thought I'd set up a deterministic environment to tweak the resource constraints and fire multiple queries at them.

Currently, this is just a very basic node server the connects to mongo.

There is no grafana yet.
